Try–Catch Practice
----------
1. Safe Car Removal
Modify removeCar() so the program asks the user for an index. Use try–catch to handle both:
IndexOutOfBoundsException (invalid index).
NumberFormatException (if the user writes text instead of a number).

// BONUS: Make ONLY if you are ready with your other 1. exercises in ArrayList and Enum package.
2. FuelType Input
Let the user type a fuel type ("PETROL", "ELECTRIC", etc.) and try to convert it to FuelType.valueOf().
Use try–catch to catch IllegalArgumentException if they type something invalid.
